# simple_calculator
A project made in Flutter, in which the interface and functionality of a calculator were made.

Initially tested only on Android, because I don't have IOS and my computer can't run an emulator.

The same was done only for improvement in studies, where, I believe, this is a way for me to get more experience in the framework.

For run project, in your smartphone or emulator, you'll need have the flutter instaled in your computer.

- For run the project, open terminal in folder of project and execute the command : flutter run or flutter run --profile
